MTMA project ideas:
=> You can store the last invoice print time and using the moment.js lib. you can show the time last invoice was printed
=> if the fields are going to changes constantly then you can just prompt a form which takes user input for the fields and those fields will be added to the invoice
=> host the backend on vercel and run the frontend on local server.(also find a way if you can run a service instead of normal way.)  
reciept number should be auto incremental and stored in db with the invoice.

Preview Reciept page remove navbar - Done.
Check whether the buttons comes into the printer preview if they do remove them -

View Records sections:
=> Search for the record based on the institute or student or receipt
=> search out for more requirments and decide if you need moment.js

=> Pending in module one:-
-> Print the invoice from view page.
